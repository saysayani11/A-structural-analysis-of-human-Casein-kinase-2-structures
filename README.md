# COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURES (HUMAN CK2A)

## TASK:

The task aims at analyzing various structures of human casein kinase 2 alpha subunit from the PDB, solved at different resolutions, differing among each other with respect to bound ligands/molecules. Analysis includes extraction of common regions from all the structures and studying their RMSD and B-Factor plots. 

## SUMMARY:

3D representative structures of proteins give insights into mechanisms of disease and allow the design of diagnostic agents. A computational understanding of structures along with experimental data is advantageous. Several methods popularly used to determine the structure of a protein are X-Ray Crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy and Cryo-electron microscopy. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a repository of such solved structures of biomolecules using these experimental techniques. It allows for searching and exploring deposited structures under a unique PDB entry. The PDB file holds the following information:

1.	HEADER, TITLE, AUTHOR records
2.	REMARK records
3.	SEQRES records
4.	ATOM records
5.	HETATOM records

Often the most used information in a structure file is the coordinates of each ATOM record that describes the atomâ€™s location in #D space, an associated occupancy and a temperature factor. 


## DATA AVAILABILITY:

The structural information of 20 human CK2A in various bound/free forms have been extracted from their respective PDB files.
The dataset in placed as a folder located in the main repository.

## CODE AVAILABILITY:

The scripts folder placed at the main repository contains all scripts.
